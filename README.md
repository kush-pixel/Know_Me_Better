# Know Me Better

Know me Better is a static web-portfolio generator which seamlessly integrates with your github account to showcase your portfolio to the entire world.

## Technologies
1) We have used the NEXT and MERN architecture to build this app.  
2) NEXT JS provides us with a preconfigured node server with a built in file handling system to keep the API's seperate from the frontend part.  
3) It also provides us with a preconfigured React server along with routing, which we have used to create the frontend.  
4) User Authentication has been handled using Next JS via github OAuth as it is meant For Developers.
5) It makes server handling very easy by utilizing soft and hot reloading.

## Future Scope
This application has a lot of future scope, and there are a lot of additions that we plan to do to this over time.
1. Make multiple hook architectures to add even more integrations like Medium, Gitlab, etc.
2. Make user specific custom links which he can use to send his web portfolio to different people. (This needs AWS/GCP integrations)
3. Update the frontend.
4. Add additional resume templates. (Right now we only have one)
5. Allow user to customize his own resume. (Something like canva)
